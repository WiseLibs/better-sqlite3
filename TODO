---------- Polish ----------
use SQLITE_ENABLE_API_ARMOR compilation option while developing

reduce the number of memory copies:
- when binding strings, I can use SQLITE_STATIC if I make the string temporarily persistent
- when binding blobs, I can do the same thing as above, as long as I'm not scared of the user changing the buffer's underlying memory mid-execution

optimize binding by creating bind maps when statements and transactions are
created. This way, we can eliminate overhead caused by the NextAnonIndex()
and GetNamedParameterIndex() functions

remove utf8 conversion from BindObject (Binder and MultiBinder)

use hash table on the database object to remember statements that are valid, and what their column names and column counts are

polish the changes/last_row_id API of .run()

if we promisify run(), get(), all(), or each(), their performance will suffer
if more than 3 arguments are passed (more than 2 bound arguments for each())

investigate BEGIN IMMEDIATE as an alternative to mutexes
(if we dont need sqlite3_last_insert_rowid or sqlite3_changes, do we get a performance boost?)

---------- Package ----------
deal with ./test/ and .travis.yml


---------- Executable ----------
all tables should have INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL

in order for foreign keys to be unconditionally enforced, the child column must have NOT NULL

null values count as unique from eachother for UNIQUE constraints (and basically everything else)

DEFAULT applies when no value is specified for an INSERT. Explicitly given nulls do not trigger DEFAULT

foreign key REFERENCES <table> can be followed by ON DELETE and/or ON UPDATE:
SET NULL = when the parent's column is updated or deleted, the child's column becomes null
           (this still causes a violation if the child has NOT NULL)
SET DEFAULT = when the parent's column is updated or deleted, the child's column becomes the DEFAULT
              (this still causes a violation if the DEFAULT does not correspond with an actual parent)
CASCADE = when the parent row is deleted, the child row is deleted
          (for updates, the value propogates to all children)

ALTER TABLE actions

DROP TABLE actions


---------- Future API ----------
- begin()
This returns a Transaction object. You can use .and() to append statements into the transaction. These statements may be read-only, or not. When finished adding statements, you must use .end() or .commit(), after which the transaction can be .run() (possibly multiple times). The .run() method returns a promise, which resolves with an object describing the changes, or rejects with an Error.
