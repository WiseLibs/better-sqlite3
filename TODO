---------- Polish ----------
use SQLITE_ENABLE_API_ARMOR compilation option while developing

use hash table on the database object to remember statements that are valid, and what their column names, column counts, and bind maps are

polish the changes/last_row_id API of .run()

if we promisify run(), get(), all(), or each(), their performance will suffer
if more than 3 arguments are passed (more than 2 bound arguments for each())

investigate BEGIN IMMEDIATE as an alternative to mutexes
(if we dont need sqlite3_last_insert_rowid or sqlite3_changes, do we get a performance boost?)

remove FrozenBuffer if not used

---------- Package ----------
deal with ./test/ and .travis.yml


---------- Executable ----------
all tables should have INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL

in order for foreign keys to be unconditionally enforced, the child column must have NOT NULL

null values count as unique from eachother for UNIQUE constraints (and basically everything else)

DEFAULT applies when no value is specified for an INSERT. Explicitly given nulls do not trigger DEFAULT

foreign key REFERENCES <table> can be followed by ON DELETE and/or ON UPDATE:
SET NULL = when the parent's column is updated or deleted, the child's column becomes null
           (this still causes a violation if the child has NOT NULL)
SET DEFAULT = when the parent's column is updated or deleted, the child's column becomes the DEFAULT
              (this still causes a violation if the DEFAULT does not correspond with an actual parent)
CASCADE = when the parent row is deleted, the child row is deleted
          (for updates, the value propogates to all children)

ALTER TABLE actions

DROP TABLE actions


---------- Future API ----------
- begin()
This returns a Transaction object. You can use .and() to append statements into the transaction. These statements may be read-only, or not. When finished adding statements, you must use .end() or .commit(), after which the transaction can be .run() (possibly multiple times). The .run() method returns a promise, which resolves with an object describing the changes, or rejects with an Error.
